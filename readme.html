            Program D offers several choices for how it interacts with users. Depending upon your needs, you may or may
            not need to download additional software. Here&#39;s a quick guide:

        <h3>
            0.1. Get the Java Runtime (or SDK)
        </h3>
        <p>
            You need to download and install a Java 2 version 1.5 compatible JVM. Examples are the Sun JRE (Java
            Runtime Edition) or SDK (Software Development Kit). The JRE is much smaller than the SDK (~16MB as compared
            with ~44!!!). You only need the SDK if you want to rebuild the program, or want to develop Java programs of
            your own. You can download the necessary software and find installation instructions at <a
            href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/download.jsp"
            target="_blank">http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/download.jsp</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you want to recompile the program, build the documentation, or rebuild a .war file, you will also need
            <a href="http://ant.apache.org">Ant</a>.
        </p>
        <h3>
            0.2. Get Some AIML
        </h3>
        <p>
            The Program D download includes a test suite for verifying AIML compatibility, which is enough to check
            that your installation is working, but doesn&#39;t provide for much of a conversation. At <a
            href="http://aitools.org/aiml-sets">http://aitools.org/aiml-sets</a>, you&#39;ll find several choices of
            freely-available AIML. Pick one and download it.
        </p>
        <h2>
            <a id="installation">1. Installation</a>
        </h2>
        <h3>
            1.0. Java
        </h3>
        <p>
            We won&#39;t cover installation instructions for the JRE/Java SDK here. We&#39;ll just assume that
            you&#39;ve followed the instructions. In the following, we&#39;ll refer to the directory where you
            installed Java as <var>JAVA_HOME</var>. (If you use Windows, this might be something
            like <code class="path">C:\jdk1.5.0_06</code>. If you&#39;re using Linux, this might be <code class="path">/usr/java/jdk1.5.0_06</code>.)
        </p>
        <p>
            You should at least be able to type &quot;<kbd>java -version</kbd>&quot; at a command
            line (syntax may vary) and get a response something like:
        </p>
<pre class="example">
java version &quot;1.5.0_06&quot;
Java(TM) 2 Runtime Environment, Standard Edition (build 1.5.0_06-b05)
Java HotSpot(TM) Client VM (build 1.5.0_06-b05, mixed mode, sharing)
</pre>
        <p>
            If you get some kind of error like &quot;command not found&quot;, check that your system path settings are
            correct. Or, just try &quot;<var>JAVA_HOME</var><kbd>/java
            -version</kbd>&quot; (Linux) or &quot;<var>JAVA_HOME</var><kbd>\java.exe -version</kbd>&quot; (Windows), substituting your actual <span
            class="user-value">JAVA_HOME</span> path.
        </p>
        <h3>
            1.1. Program D
        </h3>
        <p>
            If you&#39;re upgrading from a previous version, please check the <a href="release-notes.html">release
            notes</a>, since some configuration files may have changed.
        </p>
        <p>
            Unzip/untar the Program D download in a convenient location. On Linux, we suggest <span
            class="literal">/usr/local/ProgramD</span>; on Windows, the root directory (<span
            class="literal">C:\</span>, perhaps) is as good as anything. The unzipping/untarring process will create a
            directory called <code class="path">ProgramD</code> that will contain all the program files.
        </p>
        <p>
            Linux users may type:
        </p>
        <p class="example">
            <kbd>tar xvjf programd-4.6-bin.tar.bz2</kbd>
        </p>
        <p>
            Windows 95-2000 users could try a free unzip utility such as <a href="http://www.7-zip.org">7-Zip</a>.
            Windows XP users will find that XP is able to open the zip file and guide you through extracting it using a
            &quot;wizard&quot;.
        </p>
        <p>
            We&#39;ll refer to the root directory created by the unzip/untar (such as <code class="path">/usr/alice/ProgramD</code>) as <var>PROGRAMD</var>.
        </p>
        <p class="important-note">
            <strong>IMPORTANT NOTE:</strong> Windows users should be sure that Program D is installed in a path that
            does <em>not</em> include spaces. For instance, use <code class="path">C:\ProgramD</code>, but do
            <em>not</em> use <code class="path">C:\Program Files\Program D</code>.
        </p>
        <h4>
            1.1.1 Compile (source downloads only)
        </h4>
        <p>
            If you downloaded the binary version of Program D (<code class="path">programd-4.6-bin.tar.bz2</code> or
            <code class="path">programd-4.6-bin.zip</code>), you can skip this step and go on to <a
            href="#1.1.2-verify-installation">1.1.2 Verify Installation</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you downloaded the source version of Program D (<code class="path">programd-4.6-src.tar.bz2</code> or
            <code class="path">programd-4.6-src.zip</code>), you will need to compile the code before you can run
            it. As mentioned above, you will need to have installed <a href="http://ant.apache.org">Ant</a> in order to
            compile the code. The default target in the <code class="path">build.xml</code> file included with
            Program D will compile the jars:
        </p>
<pre class="example">

</pre>
        <p>
            <strong>NOTE:</strong> If you have a release of JDK 1.5 that is earlier than Update 6
            (&quot;1.5.0_06&quot;), then you will see a few warning messages like this:
        </p>
<pre class="example">
    [javac] /home/noel/ProgramD/JavaSource/org/aitools/programd/util/ClassRegistry.java:58: warning: [unchecked] unchecked cast

</pre>
        <p>
            However, as you can see from annotations in the source code, all these warnings <em>have</em> been
            evaluated and <em>are</em> known. Prior to Update 6 of JDK 1.5, javac did not pay attention to <code class="java-annotation">@SuppressWarnings</code> annotations (see SDN <a
            href="http://bugs.sun.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=4986256">Bug 4986256</a>). If you use Update 6 or
            later, you should not see any of these warnings. In any case, the compile should proceed without errors.

        </h4>
        <p>
            The Program D distribution includes the set of test cases used to check AIML interpreter functionality, and
            as shipped, it is configured to load this small AIML set. Therefore, you can verify the installation
            &quot;out of the box&quot; if you wish, by running the simple console immediately. See <a
            href="#startup">First Startup</a> for tips on running the simple console. If all is well, you should see
            something like this:
        </p>
<pre class="example">
[noel@vasya ProgramD]$ bin/simple-console

JAVA_HOME is not set in your environment.
I found a java executable in &quot;/usr/bin&quot;.
I have set JAVA_HOME to &quot;/usr&quot;.
Please consider setting your JAVA_HOME environment variable.

        <h3>
            1.2. AIML
        </h3>
        <p>
            We suggest creating a subdirectory called &quot;<code class="path">aiml</code>&quot; in your <span
            class="user-value">PROGRAMD</span> directory, and then arranging your AIML files there in a way that makes
            sense to you. You&#39;ll need to unzip/untar as above.
        </p>
        <p>
            Note that, starting with version 4.5 of Program D, your AIML <em>must</em> declare the AIML namespace URI.
            The AIML set you download may not yet have been properly formatted in this way; if this is so, you should
            make the changes yourself. The namespace declaration is made on the opening tag of the root element of the
            document (the <code class="start-tag">aiml</code> tag). At minimum, you should add this declaration:
        </p>
        <p class="example">
            xmlns=&quot;http://alicebot.org/2001/AIML-1.0.1&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
            Also, if your AIML contains HTML markup (which is common in many AIML sets), you will need to do two
            things:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Declare the HTML or XHTML namespace and assign it to a prefix. This should also be done on the root
                    element. This may look like:
                </p>
                <p class="example">
                    xmlns:html=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml&quot;
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Add the prefix you associated with the HTML/XHTML namespace to all HTML/XHTML elements in the
                    document. (This is less onerous than it might sound if you use a shell script or batch file.)
                </p>
                <p>
                    For instance, every instance of
                </p>
                <p class="example">
                    &lt;br /&gt;
                </p>
                <p>
                    should become
                </p>
                <p class="example">
                    &lt;html:br/&gt;
                </p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            Additionally, please note that your HTML/XHTML markup (all of the markup, in fact) must be valid XML-in
            other words, an opening tag must have a corresponding closing tag (<code class="start-tag">some-element</code><code class="end-tag">some-element</code>), and an empty element (&quot;atomic
            tag&quot;) must be properly notated (<code class="element">some-element</code>).
        </p>
        <p>
            This will all be obvious to you if you are using contemporary standards and standards-based tools, but
            several years ago the notion of well-formed XML was not something universally familiar, and so some AIML
            sets still include orphaned tags and other detritus that needs to be cleaned up.
        </p>
        <p>
            So, starting from a root element that looks simply like:
        </p>
        <p class="example">
            &lt;aiml&gt;
        </p>
        <p>
            you will wind up with something like:
        </p>
<pre class="example">
&lt;aiml version=&quot;1.0.1&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://alicebot.org/2001/AIML-1.0.1&quot;
      xmlns:html=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml&quot;&gt;

        <h4>
            optional step
        </h4>
        <p>
            For purposes of editing AIML locally, you would be well advised to include an <span
            class="literal">xsi:schemaLocation</span> notation pointing to a local copy of the AIML schema. If you do
            not, then your XML editing application will attempt to connect to the aitools.org server to grab the schema
            whenever it needs to validate AIML, which is probably undesirable (for you and for us). (Note that Program
            D will <em>not</em> connect to the aitools.org server-it knows to look at the local copy of the schema.)
            Just as you would keep a copy of the XHTML schema locally for validating XHTML, you want to keep and point
            to a copy of the AIML schema. A copy of the AIML schema is included in the Program D distribution. There
            are two ways of pointing to it. The most direct approach is to add the following, again to the root
            element:
        </p>
        <p class="example">
            xmlns:xsi=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance&quot;<br />
             xsi:schemaLocation=&quot;http://alicebot.org/2001/AIML-1.0.1 resources/schema/AIML.xsd&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
            However, this has the disadvantage that it hard-codes a local file path in your AIML file. (It is also
            technically incorrect, since the second part of the <code>schemaLocation</code> is supposed
            to be a &quot;canonical&quot; URI.) So, if you are using an XML system that supports the use of XML
            Catalogs, you can enter the following:
        </p>
        <p class="example">
            xsi:schemaLocation=&quot;http://alicebot.org/2001/AIML-1.0.1 http://aitools.org/aiml/schema/AIML.xsd&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
            and then, in your catalog file, include an entry like this:
        </p>
        <p class="example">
            &lt;system systemId=&quot;http://aitools.org/aiml/schema/AIML.xsd&quot;
            uri=&quot;./schema/AIML.xsd&quot;/&gt;
        </p>
        <p>
            Again, an example catalog file is included in the Program D distribution.
        </p>

        </h2>
        <p>
            There&#39;s a lot to configure with Program D. What&#39;s needed for you really depends on how you want to
            use the program. If you don&#39;t care about using Program D with chat interfaces like AOL Instant
            Messenger or IRC, you won&#39;t be interested in the information about &quot;<a
            href="#config-listeners">Chat Listeners</a>&quot;. If you don&#39;t care about high-volume applications, or
            don&#39;t really want to do database-based log analysis, you can skip the &quot;<a
            href="#config-database">Database</a>&quot; section. In any case, you <em>will</em> be interested in the
            next section:
        </p>
        <h3>
            <a id="config-bots">2.0. Bots</a>
        </h3>
        <p>
            Program D lets you configure an unlimited number of bots that can run at the same time. The bots are
            configured in the <var>PROGRAMD</var>/<code>conf/bots.xml</code> file.
            (In previous releases, this file was called <code>startup.xml</code>.)
        </p>
        <p>
            Open the <code>bots.xml</code> file. Notice that the root element is called <span
            class="literal">&lt;bots&gt;</span>. Inside <code class="start-tag">bots</code>, we place one or more
            <code class="start-tag">bot</code> elements. These <code class="start-tag">bot</code> elements
            are not the same as the AIML tag of the same name.
        </p>
        <p>
            Each <code class="start-tag">bot</code> element has two important attributes: <span
            class="literal">id</span> and <code>enabled</code>. The first one assigns an identifier,
            which should be unique, for the bot. The identifier will be used internally by the engine and will be
            written to some log resources. The <code>enabled</code> attribute should have either of the
            values &quot;<code>true</code>&quot; or &quot;<code>false</code>&quot;. If
            the value is &quot;<code>true</code>&quot;, then Program D will try to load that bot when
            the server starts up. Switching <code>enabled</code> to &quot;<span
            class="literal">false</span>&quot; is an easy way to quickly turn off a bot configuration that you
            don&#39;t want to use (although a restart is required).
        </p>
        <p>
            Within the <code class="start-tag">bot</code> element we define <strong>bot properties</strong>,
            <strong>listeners</strong>, <strong>default predicates</strong>, <strong>substitutions</strong>,
            <strong>sentence-splitters</strong> and <strong>learn directives</strong>.
        </p>
        <h4>
            <a id="config-bot-properties">2.0.0. Bot Properties</a>
        </h4>
        <p>
            <strong>Bot properties</strong> are predicates that cannot be changed during the runtime life of the bot,
            but which <em>can</em> be included in AIML patterns for matching. A common property to define for a bot is
            &quot;<code>name</code>&quot;. Bot properties are defined in individual <span
            class="literal">&lt;property&gt;</span> elements inside a bot&#39;s <span
            class="literal">&lt;properties&gt;</span> element, as in this example:
        </p>
        <p class="example">
            &lt;property name=&quot;master&quot; value=&quot;Joe Schmoe&quot;/&gt;
        </p>
        <p>
            This associates the bot property name &quot;<code class="name">master</code>&quot; with the value
            &quot;<code class="value">Joe Schmoe</code>&quot;.
        </p>
        <p>
            The included <code>bots.xml</code> file uses a <code>properties</code>
            element with a <code>href</code> element that points to a separate file, <span
            class="literal">properties.xml</span>. This approach, which can also be used for predicates, sentence
            splitters, and substitutions, allows easier maintenance of these items, and makes it possible for multiple
            bots to use the same sets of these elements. You can, if you wish, also define these items in the same
            file, as children of the <code>properties</code> (or other) element, omitting the <span
            class="literal">href</span> attribute.
        </p>
        <p>
            Properties don&#39;t mean anything unless your AIML uses them. You can display the value of a bot property
            inside an AIML template by using the form <span class="literal">&lt;bot name=&quot;<span
            class="user-value">property-name</span>&quot;/&gt;</span>.
        </p>
        <h4>
            (2.0.1. Listeners)
        </h4>
        <p>
            Listeners are discussed in more detail <a href="#config-listeners">below</a>.
        </p>
        <h4>
            <a id="config-predicates">2.0.2. Default Predicates</a>
        </h4>
        <p>
            <strong>Default predicates</strong> can be thought of as your bot&#39;s &quot;assumptions&quot; about new
            users. While AIML allows you to use <span class="literal">&lt;set name=&quot;<span
            class="user-value">predicate-name</span>&quot;&gt;</span> <var>...something...</var>
            <code class="end-tag">set</code> and <span class="literal">&lt;get name=&quot;<span
            class="user-value">predicate-name</span>&quot;/&gt;</span> forms without any sort of
            &quot;declaration&quot;, Program D does allow you to set default values to associate with any predicate
            names you wish, so that you have more control over what is returned by <span class="literal">&lt;get
            name=&quot;<var>predicate-name</var>&quot;/&gt;</span> if a corresponding <span
            class="literal">&lt;set&gt;</span> has not yet happened for a given user.
        </p>
        <p>
            The <code class="start-tag">predicates</code> section, if it exists, may directly include one or more
            <code class="start-tag">predicate</code> children, or it may use an &quot;<span
            class="literal">href</span>&quot; attribute, as in the example, that points to another file where the
            predicates are defined.
        </p>
        <p>
            You can also use <code class="start-tag">predicate</code> elements to mark a predicate as <a
            href="http://aitools.org/aiml/spec#section-aiml-predicate-behaviors"
            target="_blank">return-name-when-set</a>. For instance, this predicate definition is included in a sample
            file:
        </p>
        <p class="example">
            &lt;predicate name=&quot;he&quot; default=&quot;somebody&quot; set-return=&quot;name&quot;/&gt;
        </p>
        <p>
            This means that when <code class="start-tag">set name=&quot;he&quot;</code> <span
            class="user-value">...</span> <code class="end-tag">set</code> is included in a template, the name
            of the predicate, &quot;<code>he</code>&quot;, will be displayed, rather than whatever
            value is associated with the name by the <code class="start-tag">set</code>.
        </p>
        <h4>
            <a id="config-substitutions">2.0.3. Substitutions</a>
        </h4>
        <p>
            <strong>Substitutions</strong> have several different purposes, depending on their type.
            <strong>Input</strong> substitutions contribute to the process of <a
            href="http://aitools.org/aiml/spec#section-input-normalization" target="_blank">input normalization</a>.
            <code>person</code> substitutions provide macros for transformations by the <a
            href="http://aitools.org/aiml/spec#section-person" target="_blank">&lt;person&gt;</a> tag; likewise <span
            class="literal">person2</span> and <code>gender</code> apply to the <a
            href="http://aitools.org/aiml/spec#section-person2" target="_blank">&lt;person2&gt;</a> and <a
            href="http://aitools.org/aiml/spec#section-gender" target="_blank">&lt;gender&gt;</a> tags, respectively.
        </p>
        <p>
            Starting in version 4.5, the <code>find</code> attributes of substitutions are parsed as
            regular expressions. This lends a great deal more power and precision to the input normalization step, and
            to the <code>gender</code>, <code>person</code> and <span
            class="literal">person2</span> processors. For a guide to the regular expression syntax that is available,
            see the <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/api/java/util/regex/Pattern.html#sum">JDK
            documentation</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Each individual substitution specification, regardless of whether it is inside an <span
            class="literal">&lt;input&gt;</span>, <code class="start-tag">gender</code>, <span
            class="literal">&lt;person&gt;</span> or <code class="start-tag">person2</code>, takes the same form
            as this example from <code>conf/substitutions.xml</code>:
        </p>
        <p class="example">
            &lt;substitute find=&quot;\bbecasue\b&quot; replace=&quot;because&quot;/&gt;
        </p>
        <p>
            This means that, when this substitution is applied, each instance of the separate word &quot;becasue&quot;
            will be replaced with &quot;because&quot;. (This is an example of typo correction in Program D.)
        </p>
        <p>
            Note the use of the <code>\b</code> marker, which is regular expression notation for
            &quot;word boundary&quot;. In previous versions of Program D, you were advised to pad find and replace
            strings with spaces, as a way of approximating word boundary matching. This is no longer advised, and in
            fact will not work properly now that regular expression support is included.
        </p>
        <h4>
            <a id="config-sentence-splitters">2.0.4. Sentence-Splitters</a>
        </h4>
        <p>
            <strong>Sentence-splitters</strong>, as described in the <a
            href="http://aitools.org/aiml/spec#section-sentence-splitting-normalizations" target="_blank">AIML
            spec</a>, are:
        </p>
        <p class="blockquote">
            ...heuristics applied to an input that attempt to break it into &quot;sentences&quot;. The notion of
            &quot;sentence&quot;, however, is ill-defined for many languages, so the heuristics for division into
            sentences are left up to the developer.
        </p>
        <p>
            Since sentence-splitters are applied to the input <em>after</em> substitution normalizations, they can be
            more general rules. The entire collection of example sentence-splitters shipped with Program D is:
        </p>
        <p class="example">
            &lt;sentence-splitters&gt;<br />
             &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;splitter value=&quot;.&quot;/&gt;<br />
             &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;splitter value=&quot;!&quot;/&gt;<br />
             &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;splitter value=&quot;?&quot;/&gt;<br />
             &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;splitter value=&quot;;&quot;/&gt;<br />
             &lt;/sentence-splitters&gt;
        </p>
        <p>
            As with some other examples, these are defined in a separate file that is pointed to by the &quot;<span
            class="literal">href</span>&quot; attribute on the <code class="start-tag">sentence-splitters</code>
            element.

            A bot can be configured with a test suite-a set of test cases-designed to test that a bot gives appropriate
            responses to particular inputs. Within the <code>testing</code> element, you specify a
            <code>test-suite-path</code>, which should point to a file somewhere that matches the test
            suite schema (documented elsewhere), and a <code>report-directory</code>, which is where
            reports of individual test runs will be written. As shipped, Program D is configured to use its standard
            AIML test suite, and to write reports to a directory <span
            class="literal">/var/log/programd/test-reports</span> (On Windows this will be translated to <span
            class="literal">C:\var\log\programd\test-reports</span>, substituting the current drive letter for <span

        </p>
        <p>
            You can use simple &quot;glob&quot;-like wildcard patterns for specifying files to load. For example, the
            shipped <code>startup.xml</code> file has this single learn directive:
        </p>
        <p class="example">
            &lt;learn&gt;../aiml/standard/*.aiml&lt;/learn&gt;
        </p>
        <p>
            The path specification is relative to the current file, so this indicates that within a directory reached
            by going one level up (to the main <var>PROGRAMD</var> directory), and then into a
            directory called &quot;<code>aiml</code>&quot;, and from there into a subdirectory called
            &quot;<code>standard</code>&quot;, the program should load all files that end in
            &quot;<code>.aiml</code>&quot;. Note that files containing AIML are <em>not</em> required
            to have this or any particular suffix; also, if you direct the program to learn files that do not contain
            any AIML, you will receive a warning but nothing will be loaded from that file.

            <a id="config-http-server">2.1. HTTP Server</a>
        </h3>
        <p>
            If you want to be able to talk to your bot through a web interface, you&#39;ll be interested to know that
            Program D ships with a fully optional &quot;servlet&quot; implementation. A servlet is an application that
            runs on a server and interacts with users via the web. As an example we use Program D with <a
            href="http://jetty.mortbay.org" target="_blank">Jetty</a>, an open source HTTP server and servlet
            container. It is possible to integrate Program D with other servlet containers, or other application
            frameworks entirely. Here, purely for example purposes, we describe using the Jetty interface.
        </p>
        <p>
            The main file you&#39;ll be interested in is <var>PROGRAMD</var> <span
            class="literal">/conf/jetty.xml</span>. This is the file that is read by the Jetty server when it is
            invoked by Program D.
        </p>
        <p>
            The parameter that will probably be of most interest here is the port number. This is specified in the
            place that looks like:
        </p>
        <p class="example">
            &lt;Set name=&quot;Port&quot;&gt;2001&lt;/Set&gt;
        </p>
        <p>
            Most web sites use the port numbered <code>80</code>, which is the port assumed by a web
            browser when you type a URL without a port specification, so you might never have even known that there was
            such a thing as a port in a URL! Having different ports allows different server programs running on the
            same machine to answer requests without bothering each other.
        </p>
        <p>
            For testing purposes, it is probably fine to use the default value of <code>2001</code>, or
            whatever you prefer (although on some operating systems you can&#39;t use a number lower than <span
            class="literal">1024</span> without special privileges). But for serious applications you&#39;ll want to
            deal with this differently, since many firewalls don&#39;t allow people to access arbitrary ports. The
            easiest solution to the port problem is to use a proxy server (or the proxy feature of a good web server
            like <a href="http://httpd.apache.org" target="_blank">Apache</a>) to allow external users to access your
            bot using a regular web address that doesn&#39;t specify a port (i.e., through port <span
            class="literal">80</span>).
        </p>
        <p>
            You probably won&#39;t care to change the rest of the Jetty configuration file, unless you intend to use
            Jetty to serve content or run other applications besides Program D.

        <h3>
            <a id="config-listeners">2.2. Chat Listeners</a>
        </h3>
        <p>
            In current Program D nomenclature, a &quot;listener&quot; is a program that knows how to speak a particular
            protocol and interpret messages for the bot. For instance, the <code>IRCListener</code>
            understands the popular IRC protocol and allows you to connect your bot to any IRC server.
        </p>
        <p>
            You can enable one or more listeners for each bot. Each listener has its own unique configuration
            parameters, which are specific to the requirements of the protocol for which it&#39;s designed. You&#39;ll
            find examples of each currently-available listener in the <var>PROGRAMD</var>/<span
            class="literal">conf/bots.xml</span> file.
        </p>
        <p>
            Listeners for a given bot are specified within the <code class="start-tag">listeners</code> element,
            in individual <code class="start-tag">listener</code> elements. Each <span
            class="literal">&lt;listener&gt;</span> element must have two attributes: &quot;<span
            class="literal">type</span>&quot;, and &quot;<code>enabled</code>&quot;. The value for
            &quot;<code>type</code>&quot; must correspond with a value assigned by the developer to a
            listener that is somewhere in the Java classpath for Program D. The example <span
            class="literal">bots.xml</span> includes an example of each type currently known. The value of &quot;<span
            class="literal">enabled</span>&quot; must be &quot;<code>true</code>&quot; or &quot;<span
            class="literal">false</span>&quot;, allowing the listener to be switched on or off with ease.
        </p>
        <p>
            The parameters for a listener are specifed in individual <code class="start-tag">parameter</code>
            elements within the <code class="start-tag">listener</code>. For example:
        </p>
        <p class="example">
            &lt;parameter name=&quot;host&quot; value=&quot;ar.chatjunkies.org&quot;/&gt;<br />
             &lt;parameter name=&quot;port&quot; value=&quot;6667&quot;/&gt;<br />
             &lt;parameter name=&quot;nick&quot; value=&quot;programd&quot;/&gt;<br />
             &lt;parameter name=&quot;channel&quot; value=&quot;#bots&quot;/&gt;
        </p>
        <p>
            These are the parameters set for the example use of the <code>IRCListener</code>, whose
            type string is &quot;<code>ProgramD-IRC</code>&quot;.
        </p>
        <p>
            When you enable a chat listener, you will see its output mixed in with the console output. You can also
            interact with some listeners if they implement the &quot;commandable&quot; interface (see <a
            href="#commandables">below</a>).
        </p>
        <h3>
            <a id="config-database">2.3. Database</a>
        </h3>
        <p>
            You are not required to install, configure or use a database in order to use Program D. The default
            configuration is entirely based on text files in order to make setup quick, painless, and no more
            resource-intensive than necessary.
        </p>
        <p>
            However, for heavy-volume situations, and/or for cases where you want to collect dialogue in a form that
            can perhaps be more easily mined, you may wish to use a database.
        </p>
        <p>
            We have done the most extensive testing with <a href="http://www.mysql.com" target="_blank">MySQL</a>;
            however, other users have connected Program D with various other DBMSes. The major point is that you must
            have a JDBC driver for the database you wish to use. We include the MySQL JDBC driver with the Program D
            distribution for convenience.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you do want to use a database, you need to configure it properly in the <span
            class="user-value">PROGRAMD</span>/<code>core.xml</code> file. The relevant part of the
            file is this:
        </p>
<pre class="example">
    &lt;!--

         * This is only meaningful if you are using a database-enabled Multiplexor
         * and/or the database-based chat logging.

    &lt;!--Typical mySQL configuration--&gt;
    
    &lt;!--The URL of the database to use. [String: jdbc:mysql:///programdbot]--&gt;

</pre>
        <p>
            You should set these values to match your database installation. Remember that the driver class must be
            available from the Java classpath.

</pre>
        <p>
            If <code>DBMultiplexor</code> is enabled, Program D will expect to find two tables called
            <code>users</code> and <code>predicates</code> in the configured database.
            The SQL commands for creating these tables are in <var>PROGRAMD</var>/<span

        <p>
            Database-based chat logging stores each exchange with the bot in a database. This is useful for monitoring
            conversations, data mining, etc. To enable this feature, you must set:
        </p>
<pre class="example">

</pre>
        <p>
            (in <var>PROGRAMD</var> <code>/core.xml</code>). If this is enabled,
            Program D will expect to find a table called <code>chatlog</code> in the database. The
            command for creating this table is in <var>PROGRAMD</var>/<span
            class="literal">database/db-chatlog.script</span>. Note that if you are logging chats to a database, you
            might want to disable the redundant logging to XML files. You can do this by setting:

        <p>
            In its usual configuration, Program D displays information about what it is doing while it starts, runs,
            and shuts down. We call this the &quot;console&quot;. Also, you can interact with Program D via a simple
            shell, if desired. Sometimes it is simpler to use this shell than to open a web browser or IM program. Both
            the console and shell can be configured to suit your needs. Configuration for both is done in the <span

        </p>
        <p>
            As a security feature, the AIML Watcher only watches files that were loaded by a <strong>learn</strong>
            directive. If you put a new file into a directory with other AIML files, that file will <em>not</em> be
            automatically loaded (but you can load it with the <code>/load</code> shell command if you
            have access to the console and have not disabled the shell).

            Before the bot server can shut down, it must stop the http server and must save any predicates left in the
            cache. It also must stop all listeners. There are several different <a href="#shutting-down">ways to shut

            &quot;ManagedProcesses&quot; are such things as the http server and listeners. Sometimes one or more of

        <p>
            The <code>/load</code> command lets you load new AIML files, or reload files (useful if you
            have disabled the <a href="#aiml-watcher">AIML Watcher</a>.)

        <p>
            The <kbd>/unload</kbd> command lets you unload an AIML file that is currently in memory.
            You must unload using the pathname that was originally used to load it, which can be a little tricky to get
            right.

        <p>
            You can switch the bot with whom you are conversing by using the <kbd>/talkto</kbd>
            command. You must use a valid bot id as the argument. (The bot id is not necessarily the same as the value
            associated with its &quot;name&quot; property. To see bot ids, look at your <span
            class="literal">startup.xml</span> file or use the <kbd>/bots</kbd> command.
        </p>
        <p>
            Each time you switch bots, the connect string will be sent to the bot.
        </p>
        <p>
            Trying to talk to a botid that doesn&#39;t exist will result in an error message.

        <h3>
            3.3. Connecting via the Web Interface
        </h3>
        <p>
            If you want to talk to your bot through a web server, use the example <span
            class="user-value">PROGRAMD</span><code>/web-server</code> configuration. Once your bot is
            started, you can interact with it through a web browser. If you have not changed the port number (see <a
            href="#config-http-server">HTTP Server</a> above, then you should get a response when you go to this
            address:
        </p>
        <p class="example">
            http://localhost:2001
        </p>
        <p>
            Note that &quot;localhost&quot; is the name by which your computer knows itself-not only in Program D, but
            in any program that uses TCP/IP (the set of protocols that makes the Internet work). You cannot go to
            another computer and connect to yours using the name &quot;<code>localhost</code>&quot;.
            You will need to know the IP address or name of the computer where the bot is running, in order to connect
            from another machine. On Windows 95 and 98, you can find this out by running the command:
        </p>
        <p class="example">
            winipcfg
        </p>
        <p>
            On Windows NT, 2000 and XP, use:
        </p>
        <p class="example">
            ipconfig
        </p>
        <p>
            On *nix, use:
        </p>
        <p class="example">
            host
        </p>
        <p>
            Try using the hostname first (it&#39;s usually easier to remember); if that causes problems, use the IP
            address. Also note that if you are behind a firewall, or otherwise part of a network over which you do not
            have complete control, your bot may be inaccessible to users from other machines even if they know your IP
            address or hostname. In such cases, contact your system administrator or Internet service provider.
        </p>
        <p>
            Once you do succeed to connect with the bot, you should see something like this:
        </p>
        <div class="box">
            <p>
                &lt;--insert screenshot--&gt;
            </p>
        </div>
        <p>
            If you have configured more than one bot, you can request the one you want by appending a <span
            class="literal">botid</span> parameter to your request. For example:
        </p>
        <p class="example">
            http://vasya:2001?botid=TestBot-2
        </p>
        <p>
            would request the bot with id (not necessarily name!) <code>TestBot-2</code> from the
            machine <code>vasya</code>.
        </p>
        <p>
            You can also create different HTML templates for chat with your bot, by following the example provided in
            <var>PROGRAMD</var> <code>/templates/html/chat.html</code>. If you
            then want to request one of these alternate templates you can add a <code>template</code>
            parameter to the URL request. The value of this parameter should be the name of the file, minus whatever
            extension. So if you create a template file named <code>fancy.html</code> and store it in
            the <code>templates/html</code> directory, then you can use a request like this:
        </p>
        <p class="example">
            http://localhost:2001?botid=TestBot-1&amp;template=fancy
        </p>
        <h3>
            3.4. Connecting via a Chat Interface
        </h3>
        <p>
            If you have correctly configured one or more listeners (see <a href="#config-listeners">Configuring
            Listeners</a> above, then you should be able to start the appropriate chat client and communicate with your
            bot.
        </p>
        <h3>
            3.5. Shutting Down
        </h3>
        <p>
            If you start Program D with the shell enabled, you can shut down the bot from the console by typing <span
            class="literal">/exit</span> command.
        </p>
        <p>
            If the shell is disabled, you can shut down the bot by pressing the interrupt key sequence for your
            operating system; this is often <code>Ctrl-C</code>. Or, on *nix systems, you can send the
            main JVM process a <code>SIGINT</code> signal with the <code>kill</code>
            command.
