This is a release checklist, to be followed before releasing a new build.

1.  Unzip the zip bin distro into a clean directory.
2.  Start simple console and run tests ("/test").  Look for any test failures.
    (<system> and <javascript> will fail unless enabled in core.xml.)
3.  Start simple GUI and run tests.
4.  Start web server and manually type in several test case inputs.
5.  Check flash interface.
6.  Download and enable each listener and check for responsiveness.
7.  Repeat steps 1-6, using tar.bz2 bin distro.
8.  Unzip the zip source distro into a clean directory.
9.  Ensure that build works (ant conf/build.xml).
10. Repeat steps 2-6.
11. Repeat steps 9-10 using tar.bz2 bin distro.
