# 4.1.3 #
###############################################################################
Major cleanup and optimization work by Noel Bush.  User authentication
implementation sponsored by Artificial Solutions AB.

Here are the major improvements to functionality:
* User authentication for HTTP introduced
* Re-integration of targeting and minimal targeting tool (from Program dB)
* Ability to use Program D *without* a database
* much closer to AIML 1.0.x compliance, and additions to test cases to verify same
* Ability to specify substitutions (including those for person, person2
  and gender) externally
* XML logging of chat conversations
* Ability to use different templates for Responders
* better handling of character encodings for AIML files, HTML templates and http servlet
* Proper support of patterns in condition/li value attributes
* Big speed improvement for AIML loading, and for matching
* Logging format regularized (and used more than before)
* Much more configurable (see server properties)
* Ability to prohibit use of <system> and/or <javascript> tags
* Ability to deny support of deprecated AIML 0.9 tags
* Potential to use http server of choice

Here are the major improvements to code:
* Source code cleanup (all but a few files)
  * formatting standardized, grammar fixed
  * imports made explicit and cryptic variables renamed
  * complete javadoc on nearly all classes & variables
* some design improvements (more use of interfaces, less duplicated code)
* less fixed dependence on non-GPL code (Jetty is removed to a jar file, no
longer mixed in with org.alicebot code)
* some improvements to AIMLReader -- still not a "real" XML parser, but
  it's faster than anything else -- now there's less duplicated code
* similar comment for AIMLParser -- it also has "pluggable" processors

# 4.1.2 ref #
###############################################################################
Finally it's here - the final reference version of Program D! Big thanks to
Tom and Pedro, who have taken upon themselves the difficult task of bringing
the reference implementation as close to the AIML 1.0 specification as 
possible.
Their work has finished now - the server is fully under the GPL, and you can 
safely use version 4.1.2 as a reference base for further development. If it's
good, your work may even be incorporated into the next release!
-Kim, Tom and Pedro

* Targetting has been temporarily disabled 
* Code changes/fixes
  * Cleaned up the logs directory
  * Removed unused classes from server.* scripts

  * Fixed topic bug from 4.1.1
* Tag changes/fixes
  * <topicstar> <thatstar> and <star> support multiple wildcards too
  * <get> can now optionaly return a default value in case the variable is not 
    set
  * removed <if> tag
  * removed 'src' attribute from <gossip> tag
* server.engine.emtpydefault="" specifies the 'default' default return value for
  undefined bot properties and variables
* bot loading/startup has been modified & moved to a simple xml file:
  *  recognized tags for startup.xml
     * <xml></xml>
     *<learn></learn>
     * <property/>  
  * ONLY ONE TAG per line please
* Logging of empty user inputs added

# 4.1.1 ref #
###############################################################################
Another update of the reference version by Thomas Ringate and Pedro E. Colla.
It features a rewrite of the template parser, support for stack variables, 
re-added some lost features (scripting, substitutions). The way bot properties
are handled also changed.
For instructions on how to set up the server, see _readme.txt.
- Kim, Tom and Pedro

* Code changes/fixes
  * Parser rewritten (AIMLParser.java), now fully recursive
* License text provided by Noel Bush on all modified code.
* Official Copyright notice added.
* Server starting message (previously in SERVER.BAT).
* Tag changes/fixes
  * <if></if> full implementation ---> according with archcomm discussions
  * <person> <person2> <gender> substitutions
  * <javascript> implemented (like <script> in ProgramD baseline).
  * Normalize the arguments before <srai> on them.
  * Solved sequencing problem at load time that prevented the simultaneous
    usage of the <learn></learn> and <load filename="XXX"/> forms.
  * Some template tags are processed at load time, rather than just at 
    processing time
  * Bot properties are now defined as <property name="property" value="value"/>,
    the previous mechanism of <pattern>BOT propertyname</pattern> categories
    has been removed
  * Fixed a bug where AIML tags inside a <condition> were evaluated only
    when enclosed in <li></li> and otherwise ignored.
  * Made the value comparisson of <if>, <condition> and <li> case insensitive.
* Variable handling
  * Stack variables
    * <input index="N"/> implemented up to 5 levels of depth.
    * <that index="N,M"/> implemented up to 5 levels of depth.
      The 2nd index M is ignored
  * When the bot is started all TOPIC properties of all IP's are set to the
    default one ("").
* Change the name of the bot from the directory where the AIML is into
  the property name (<bot name="name"/>).
  * Modified legend on HTML template
* Logging & output
  * Remove the <br/> on console output (replace it by CRLF) if debug=false
  * Normalization of eol (LF vs. CRLF) on chat.log (blank lines with WordPad).
  * Blank lines removed from chat.log logging.

# 4.1.0 ref #
###############################################################################
This is the 'reference' version Thomas Ringate and Pedro E. Colla have been
working on. It is intermediate work in progress, with the goal to make Program
D AIML 1.0 compliant. Currently, in version 4.1.0 ref, the support for AIML 1.0
is partial and achieved thru quick fixes. For the most part, AIML 0.9 is not
yet supported.
Don't use this release as a base for further development, there will yet be
major changes in the code. The next release 4.1.1 will hopefully adress the
above issues within the next 2 weeks.
-Kim, Tom and Pedro


* change "localhost" legends to actual IP number.
* IO checking added when files are non-existent or empty
* std-bot.aiml must be loaded before any other AIML file if bot properties 
  other than <bot name="name"/> are used on the pattern side.
* Fixed <if> handling (all parameters and <else/> should work correctly)
* Fixed <condition> - now supports all three forms
* <sentence> now spelled correctly, as well as other occurences of this typo
* <that/> returns uppercase.
* Fixed error when AIML file contains XML empty <aiml .. /> tag.
* Added AIML 1.0 compliant variable tags
  * <get/>  
  * <bot/>
  * <set></set>
* Implemented the non-brainer AIML 1.0 tags
  * <id/>
  * <size/>
  * <version/>
  * <date/>
* Added partial support for indexed variables (return blanks when index out of
  bounds). The index may be ommited, in which case it defaults to "1".
  * <input index="N"/> N=1,2,3
  * <star index="N"/> N=1
  * <thatstar index="N"/> N=1
  * <topicstar index="N"/> N=1
  * <that index="N,M"/> N=1,2 M is ignored

# 4.0.2 # 
###############################################################################
Now comes WITHOUT any AIML, you must install an aiml set manually and configure
it in the SERVER.properties file (pointers are in the bots/readme.txt file),
otherwise you will get a 'FileNotFoundException'. You can get some AIML files
(as well as the latest server release) here:
http://www.alicebot.org
ftp://ftp.alicebot.org/pub/builds
-Kim

* Finally, the release system in the CVS works (yipee!) -> even small updates 
  are easy to release -> possibly regular updates
* Fixed buggy CVS entries that prevented .bat files from running smoothly
* Code cleanup (Mark Anacker)
* now the server.engine.startup property works
* Note - the server is not yet 1.0 compliant so the newest AIML files may not
  work, try using the 1.0.0 release

#########
# 4.0.1 #
##########################################################
First release out of the CVS, included Jon Baers AIML set.
-Kim

* New run.bat to simplify startup
* Cleanup of source, unused libraries and miscellaneous files
* compiles 'out of the box'
* speech support moved to another branch (development stopped)
