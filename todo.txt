Bugs and missing things:
* Logging of duplicate categories
* Provide save capabilities to the GM
* Indefinite depth of <input/>, <that/>, <star/>, <thatstar/>, <topicstar/>
* most (all?) listeners not working

Cleanup:
* Documentation (README.txt)

Other ideas:
* List all variables set for a user
* Working admin
* Documentation (on purpose twice)
* ICQ
* MSN/Yahoo
* Methods for logging in, may require mods in the dbase too
* Plug in architecture for listeners/responders/responder templates
* optional logging of all features in XML or something
* Installer
