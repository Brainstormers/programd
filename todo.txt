Bugs and missing things:
* Logging of duplicate categories
* Provide save capabilities to the GM
* Fix/Rewrite of the template processor (this will hopefully solve many bugs people are currently experiencing)
    * Add substitutions like <person> and <person2>
    * Support for AIML 0.9 tags (AIML 0.9 compliant bot)
* Re-structure bot properties management.
* Normalization of eol (LF vs. CRLF) on chat.log
* print actual server port instead of "2001" hardcoded.
* Indefinite depth of <input/>, <that/>, <star/>, <thatstar/>, <topicstar/>

Cleanup:
* Reduce memory leaks
* Shorten the license text in the files
* Provide a LICENSE.txt file
* Generally making the code nicer
* Documentation (README.txt)

Misc
* Sanity check for verifying that the build isn't broken (testsuite)

Features, new functions
* List all variables set for a user
* Use different dbase than hypersoic (whic seems not suited for large scale databases)
    * plug in architecture for database?
* Fix/rewrite substitutions, externalizing them
* Working admin
* Documentation (on purpose twice)
* ICQ
* MSN/Yahoo
* Methods for logging in, may require mods in the dbase too
* Plug-in architecture for template tags (it would be good if this cold be incorporated into the new parser)
* Plug in architecture for listeners/responders/responder templates
* optional logging of all features in XML or something
* Installer
